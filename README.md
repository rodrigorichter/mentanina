# [Mentanina](http://www.mentanina.com.br)

## Description

Mentanina is a web application made on Ruby On Rails and Foundation. It aggregates links about mental health and enables anyone to share his/her own story.

## Motivation

The app was founded when I(the founder) decided that I could and should do something to help people suffering from mental illnesses. The motivation for it started when I encountered deppresion myself, and was further increased by people whom I met who had bipolar disorder, and by a recent suicide case of a woman studying at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul(UFRGS).
